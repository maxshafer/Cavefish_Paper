Scripts are divided into 3 groups:

1) Scripts for clustering, annotation, and analysis of zebrafish (D. rerio) single-cell data

2) Scripts for clustering, annotation, and analysis of Mexican tetra (A. mexicanus) single-cell data. This includes analysis scripts for species-morph analyses

3) Scripts for integration, clustering, and annotation of the combination of the zebrafish and Mexican tetra datasets
